Accurate and fully automated brain tumor grading from volumetric 3D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a crucial role in enhancing neuroradiology support during clinical diagnosis. In this study, we propose a novel deep learning-based model for automated brain tumor segmentation and grading from MRI images. The model's performance was evaluated against state-of-the-art architectures, including U-Net, Attention-U-Net, and Swin-Unet, using key segmentation metrics such as Mean Intersection over Union (MloU), Mean Pixel Accuracy (MPA), Mean Precision, and Mean Dice coefficient. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms existing methods, achieving a MloU of 87.20\%, MPA of 91.30\%, Precision of 95.10\%, and a Dice coefficient of 92.80\%. Compared to the baseline U-Net model, which recorded a MloU of 76.26\% and a Dice coefficient of 85.90\%, our model shows a significant improvement in segmentation accuracy and precision. These findings highlight the model's potential to accurately identify tumor regions, making it a robust tool for automated brain tumor grading and clinical support in neuroradiology.
